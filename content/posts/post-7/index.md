# About the Framework
Let's talk a bit more about the Five Truths Framework I decided to structure this site around. As mentioned in the first post, the framework I'm using is based on Nāgārjuna's Two Truths doctrine, a concept central to Mahāyāna  Buddhism. Although similar ideas can be traced back to pre-Buddha times (Yajnavalkya 2008, III.2.3.6), the doctrine was largely established in Nāgārjuna’s *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (MMK) around 150 CE, which distinguished between two categories of truth:
1.	Conventional Truths (*Samvrti-satya*): Truths perceived and used in everyday life, shaped by conventions, mutual dependencies, and appearances. These truths rely on relational and contingent phenomena that obscure the ultimate nature of reality.
2.	Ultimate Truths (*Paramārtha-satya*): Truths revealing the true nature of reality as it is – free from conceptual overlays and obscurations. This corresponds to the realization of emptiness (*śūnyatā*) (Nāgārjuna 1986, 24.8).

Around 600 years after the composition of the MMK, Japanese Yogācāra scholar-monk Zenju deconstructed the Two Truths into four hierarchical levels, reflecting a progression from surface understandings to profound realizations. Zenju’s “Four Levels of the Twofold Truths” can be observed in the Table 1 (Moro 2018, 79-90).

It's important to note that Nāgārjuna’s Two Truths are not meant to be separate realities, but rather two aspects of the same reality. Nāgārjuna’s doctrine of “the emptiness of emptiness” asserts that emptiness itself is dependently arisen, as it cannot exist inherently and relies on conventional phenomena to be understood (Jerome 2018). This interdependence implies that emptiness is also empty; if it were inherently existent, it would contradict the nature of emptiness and negate the truth that all phenomena are empty. Thus, emptiness can only conventionally exist, and for the unenlightened, ultimate truths are accessible only through conventional truths. The Two Truths are therefore ontologically inseparable – like two sides of the same coin. Zenju’s Four Levels conveys a similar idea but shifts the parity between conventional and ultimate levels down one step: the levels of conventional truths represent words, and their corresponding ultimate truths represent the substances that establish the words. As \(\text{C}_1\) is the “truth established only by language or verbal convention, while \(\text{U}_\) is the truth based only on reality beyond language,” \(\text{C}_2\) is equivalent to \(\text{U}_1\), \(\text{C}_3\) is equivalent to \(\text{U}_2\), \(\text{C}_4\) is equivalent to \(\text{U}_3\), and \(\text{C}_1\) is too devoid of ontological basis to have an equivalent level of ultimate truth, while \(\text{U}_4\) transcends language and concepts in a way that is fundamentally incompatible with any level of conventional truth (Moro 2018, 82-83). Thus, I would argue that it is more helpful to understand the hierarchy through **five levels:**

1. **Level 1**: \(\text{C}_1\)

2. **Level 2**: \(\text{C}_2 = \text{U}_1\)
3. **Level 3**: \(\text{C}_3 = \text{U}_2\)
4. **Level 4**: \(\text{C}_4 = \text{U}_3\)
5. **Level 5**: \(\text{U}_4\)

# Why Use the Truth Hierarchy?
The Buddhist distinction between lower and higher truths creates an **incredibly** important framework to facilitate intellectually honest and consistent discourse on many topics. It's a powerful way to acknowledge the limits of conventional language and ideas &mdash; things we use all the time but might not actually believe to be representative of reality. Creating distinctions between levels of truth gives us a way to free certain ideas from linguistic constraints and confusion. I sometimes like to think of and express the Two Truths doctrine, along with the Buddhist idea of emptiness (Buddhist emptiness being some sort of ontological resolution to global skepticism) in terms of simulation theory. More specifically, the idea that if we're in a simulation where the programmers perfectly restrict our ability to truly comprehend (even if we can conceptualize it) that we are in a simulation (and thus not the ultimate reality), then we can't prove, or even evidence that we aren't in a simulation. Similarly, the programmers who created the simulation wouldn't be able to prove (or even evidence) that they aren't in a simulation run by a "more ultimate" reality. There isn't necessarily a sentient programmer in Buddhism, but there is the idea of trying to "escape the simulation" that is our perceived reality. Simplifying the idea to layers of TV shows &mdash; shows within shows, where the writers write that the characters can't comprehend that they might not exist &mdash; might be a more direct way to understand the distinction between conventional and ultimate truths. When we discuss characters or events in a TV show, we don't keep bringing up the fact that the characters don't exist or that the events aren't actually happening &mdash; that wouldn't be relevant to our analyses/conversations (and it'd be pretty annoying).
