Hi! This blog is my way of documenting some of my thoughts, research, opinions, and more. 

There's no rigid theme, but my current interests are largely divided between topics within:
1. Metaphyiscs &mdash; the philosophy of self, free will, Buddhist philosophy
2. Gambling &mdash; betting strategies, prediction markets, risk behavior

A bit about me: I'm a college student majoring in econ & data science who's trying to more about:
- Behavioral economics
- Decision theory
- Game theory
- Philosophy
- Mathematics
- Sports
- Alternative markets

A few of my hobbies:
- Chess &mdash; I'm very rusty, but send me a challenge on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/salcastuchiano) or catch me @ the [Chess Forum](https://www.chessforum.com/) when I'm back in NY
- Watching NBA & UFC &mdash; I'm a fan of all things Knicks & Petr Yan
- Zetamac &mdash; try to beat my high score of 144! (though my highest **recorded** score was [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/MTKPN-nnpSw?si=8bV_O5dnGV-WqTAy))
- Cooking &mdash; I make really good fried rice, steak, pan-roasted fish, and steamed eggs
- Listening to music & making [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ow6ad6boduguylrvmmq94t63d?si=75bac8c432a840d6) playlists
