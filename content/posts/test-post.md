Hi! This blog is my way of documenting some of my thoughts, research ideas, opinions, and more. 

There's no rigid theme, but my current interests are largely divided between:
1. Metaphyiscs &mdash; the philosophy of self, free will, Buddhist philosophy
2. Betting &mdash; risk behavior, betting strategies, prediction markets

A bit about me: I'm a college student studying economics who's trying to learn more about:
- Behavioral economics
- Decision theory
- Game theory
- Philosophy
- Mathematics
- Sports
- Alternative markets

Some hobbies of mine:
- Chess &mdash; I'm very rusty, but send me a challenge on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/salcastuchiano) or catch me @ the [Chess Forum](https://www.chessforum.com/) when I'm home in NY
- Watching NBA & UFC &mdash; big fan of the Knicks & Petr Yan
- Playing [Zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/) &mdash; try to beat my high score of **144** on default settings (my highest **recorded** score was [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/MTKPN-nnpSw?si=8bV_O5dnGV-WqTAy))
- Cooking &mdash; I make really good fried rice, steak, pan-roasted fish, and steamed eggs
- Listening to music & making [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ow6ad6boduguylrvmmq94t63d?si=75bac8c432a840d6) playlists
- Drawing, sometimes
