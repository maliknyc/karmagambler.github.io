#### Levels 1 & 2

Hi! This blog is my way of documenting some of my thoughts, research ideas, opinions, and more. It's much more for myself, but if you're here, welcome! Feel free to send me any thoughts or critiques at my email: felixliangnyc@gmail.com.

There's no rigid theme, but my current interests are largely divided between:
1. Metaphyiscs &mdash; the philosophy of self, free will, Buddhist philosophy
2. Betting &mdash; risk behavior, betting strategies, prediction markets

A bit about me: I'm a college student studying economics who's trying to learn more about:
- Behavioral economics
- Decision theory
- Game theory
- Philosophy
- Mathematics
- Sports
- Alternative markets

Some hobbies of mine:
- Chess &mdash; I'm very rusty, but send me a challenge on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/salcastuchiano) or catch me @ the [Chess Forum](https://www.chessforum.com/) when I'm home in NY
- Watching NBA & UFC &mdash; big fan of the Knicks & Petr Yan
- Playing [Zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/) &mdash; try to beat my high score of **144** on default settings (my highest **recorded** score was [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/MTKPN-nnpSw?si=8bV_O5dnGV-WqTAy))
- Cooking &mdash; I make really good fried rice, steak, pan-roasted fish, and steamed eggs
- Listening to music & making [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ow6ad6boduguylrvmmq94t63d?si=75bac8c432a840d6) playlists
- Drawing, sometimes

# Five Truths Framework
At the start of every post, I'll label what *level* of truth I'll be writing on. This will be in reference to a concept adapted from Mahayana Buddhism: Nagarjuna's Two Truths doctrine. In particular, I will be using my **five**-level hierarchy of truths, a slightly modifed version of Zenju's "Four Levels of the Twofold Truths." I will go more into detail about the motivation for this in a subsequent post titled "Five Levels of Truth," but for now, the hierarchy will be defined as:
1. **Level 1: Names & Labels**
- Just words that help us function day-to-day, but don't reflect any deeper reality on their own. Useful shorthand that help us **identify** things, but are inherently arbitrary themselves. An example would be: "I think we should name our child Rose."
2. **Level 2: Practical Models & Methods**
- These are frameworks we build (like economic models and pragmatic ethical rules) that help us analyze and predict things. They're more structured than mere labels, but they're still simplified interpretations of reality. An example would be the statement, "stealing is bad."
3. **Level 3: Reasoned and Principled Understanding**
- Here, we rely on strong conceptual tools like mathematics, formal logic, direct observation, or deeper ethical reasoning to get at a truer picture. Accuracy and coherence is important, but we'll still operate within the humean realm of perception. An example would be the statement, "Upon weighing them on a scale, we can conclude that this watermelon weighs more than this apple."
4. **Level 4: Attempts to Describe the Ultimate Reality**
- At this stage, we try to articulate or at least hint at truths that might inherently exist and go beyond everyday experience, including discussions on whether we have free will, the truth nature of the self, or what the ultimate reality is (beyond human perception). We can conceptualize and verbally express the concepts of these things, but we also acknowledge that words likely can't fully capture them. An example is the principle of global skepticism itself.
5. **Level 5: Full Realization of the Ultimate Reality**
- This is the realization of the actual "whatever it really is," including all noumena outside of human perception, categories and language. This might be synonoymous with Buddhist enlightenment, though I would argue that there might be a distinction in the fact that this is likely unattainable, whereas Buddhist enlightenment is said to be attainable. The realization of lacking free will &mdash; not just conceptually understanding how you might not possess free will, but actually detaching from the inherent biological instinct that you have agency in your actions &mdash; might be another example, but it's also possible that you can realize such a thing at some level between 4 and 5. Again, we probably just can't know.
