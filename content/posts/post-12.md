Five Guys is trash. Their burgers are inherently flawed and cannot be good, and I truly believe that almost everyone who swears they enjoy Five Guys has either been fooled by their marketing, is trying to cope and justify them spending $20 on a below-average burger, or they've just never had a decent burger before.
