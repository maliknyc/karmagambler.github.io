#### Levels 2 & 3

I want this post to serve as a framework for any subsequent posts about free will. 

It's quite frustrating to watch people who **think** they're at odds in a free will debate, but instead of delving into an actual disagreement, they're just using different frameworks to describe what is &mdash; and isn't &mdash; free will. Let's minimize such confusion by laying out two of the most prominent definitions of free will, both of which are perfectly valid, but may hold at different levels of truth.

Because the main distinction between them lie in their relation to *determinism*, we should also be sure of how we're defining determinism. Here, the appropriate definition will be that of *causal determinism*: "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature" (Hoefer 2024).

The first widely recognized definition of free will in metaphysics is *incompatibilist*, or *libertarian free will*: "the power of agents to be the ultimate creators or originators and sustainers of their own ends or purposes" (Kane 1998, 4). This definition is adopted by *incompatibilists* because it holds that free will is incompatible with determinism, in which all of an agent's ends originate from a causal chain that predates that agent. 

On the other hand, the *compatibilist* view of free will is *Humean free will*, defined as a *liberty* involving "a power of acting, or not acting, according to the determinations of the will" (Hume 1975, 95). This "liberty" is sometimes conflated with Isaiah Berlin's "negative liberty": the power to act without interference from external forces (Doyle 2011, 157; Berlin 1958, 16-22). Although the Hume admirer Berlin does also use the word liberty and is specifically referring to "other persons" when he writes "external forces" – so as to say he is not just producing another incompatibilist definition by generalizing the criteria to all external constraints – the parity between Berlin's negative liberty and Hume's liberty seems dubious when we consider that Berlin was more focused on political and social freedom rather than metaphysical freedom (Berlin 1956, 163). If Berlin were concerned with metaphysical freedom and we did extend his criteria to include all external factors, then his definition would actually become an (arguably more succinct) incompatibilist definition due to the externality of the temporally continuous causal chains behind human actions. Humean free will simply implies that a person's actions qualify as "free" if their **immediate** cause was internal to the person, making no demand that there be an absence of external influence. Although it's perhaps the more robust form of free will, I would contend that it relies on a less intuitive definition of freedom insofar as it qualifies our actions as free if they are caused by us through our immediate internal motivations – even when those motivations are not necessarily caused by us. Consequently, those who adopt the compatibilist definition must also consider purely impulsive actions as free.

Incompatibilists and compatibilist perspectives don't necessariliy disagree on the **facts** of how the world operates, they simply highlight different criteria for something to be considered a freely willed action.
