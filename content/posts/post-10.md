#### Levels 2, 3, & 4

Here, I'll expand on the analysis of incompatibilist free will at lower levels of truth, examine where **compatibilist** free will holds, and discuss a few alternative definitions of self to provide additional rigor to our exploration.

At Level 2, the focus is more on identifying the foundational building blocks of experience – such as the five aggregates and the twelve sense bases – without yet recognizing their interdependent and conditional nature. While these elements have a more substantial basis than nominal constructs, dependent origination and determinism have yet to be explicitly established. Without those concepts to rest upon, it becomes difficult to reject incompatibilist free will at this level, but also difficult to prove it. Although the construction of the self seems closely intertwined with the concept of free will, the very act of inquiring into the matter would bring us to Level 3. Level 1 is less ambiguous on this matter: limited to superficial naming and linguistic conventions that do not engage with any deeper inquiry into dependent arising, dependent origination is almost entirely irrelevant here. As such, if, for the purpose of easy communication, it makes sense to treat free will as existent here, then it can be so treated.

Our analysis for compatibilist free will at the lower levels should follow a similar line of reasoning. At the lowest level, we can say agents “do as they will” within the ordinary understanding of daily life, without probing further. At Level 2, free will can operate as a conceptual model to accompany the notional formation of the self: the self acts according to internal motivations that seem real, and nothing forces a rejection of those motivations as a basis for free action. Interestingly, compatibilist free will grows more concrete at Level 3. As dependent origination comes fully into play, it establishes the internal conditions and motivations that make one’s actions their own. Because the chain of causation determining those motivations does not undermine the compatibilist’s sense of freedom, compatibilist free will holds.

As we advance to Level 4, the conceptual frameworks and principles that allowed for discussions of agency, internal motivations, and stable causes start to dissolve. The verbal establishment of *anattā* undermines the existence of internality, and compatibilist free will – grounded in the meaningfulness of internalities – loses footing. The questions one might ask, “Am I free?” or “Are my actions free?” might be met with the Buddha’s response: “You should truly see all form [and all consciousness] … with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’” (**Sujato** 2018, SN 22.59). From *anattā* alone, it seems easy to reject compatibilist (and incompatibilist) free will at Level 4. However, *anattā* alone only addresses the conceptual dissolution of the self, and it could be meaningful to explore why **emptiness** (*śūnyatā*) reinforces the untenability of free will. If the five aggregates should be – by design – treated as merely conventional designations rather than ultimate truths, one might wonder if there could be some deeper or “ultimate” conception of self – some fundamental substrate of experience or perception that we could use as the true self. If such a self existed, perhaps it could serve as the locus of free will.

**Emptiness**, as discussed in texts like the *Cūḷasuññatasutta*, reveals that all phenomena – including our notions of self and the world – are empty of intrinsic nature. The Buddha’s instructions to a mendicant to ignore perceptions of people, and the *Diamond Sutra*’s emphasis that “all that has form is illusive and unreal,” point us toward a profound skepticism about the boundaries and distinctions we use (**Sujato** 2018, MN 121; **Johnson** 2024, 5). From the Buddhist perspective, the entire phenomenal field, including what we perceive as external objects and what we conceive as internal consciousness, is interdependent, empty, and ultimately nondual. There are no truly separate entities to serve as a stable reference point, and the dissolution of subject-object duality means we cannot meaningfully isolate an “internal” self against an “external” world. From this vantage point, the notions of “internal motivation” or “internality” that compatibilist free will relies upon crumble. If there is no internality separate from externality, then there is no meaningful sense in which actions originate from a discrete agent’s will.

Still, one might try to salvage some reductionist notion of “self” through a Cartesian or Humean framework. Descartes’ famous “I am thinking therefore I exist” reasons that while we cannot trust our senses or perceptions to reveal an external world, we can at least be sure that there is some form of “experiencing” occurring (**Descartes and Maclean** 2006, 55). Then if the experience is happening, there must be an experiencing subject – some entity being impressed upon. This logic would entail that there is some existent underlying self that persists beyond the changing sensory data. But **Hume** offers an alternative perspective, arguing that while there must be a flow of perceptions, we do not need to infer a separate, stable entity that perceives. Instead, what Descartes might think of as “the perceiver” might just be another aspect or mode of perception. Rather than a substantial self, Hume describes a “bundle or collection of different perceptions,” a continuous sequence of impressions and ideas without a particular observer existing apart from the perceptions (*Hume* [1739] 2002, Sect. VI). In the Humean view, the perceptions themselves can be considered the self.

At first glance, this perspective seems strikingly compatible with *anattā*. Both deny the existence of a substantial, abiding self. If we identify the self as nothing more than an ongoing play of perceptions, then we have reduced it to something that does not need an external observer. Because there is no distinction between the observer and what is observed, it might also appear to remove duality altogether. However, Hume’s framework actually implicitly allows for the possibility of existent external *noumena* – objects outside the limits of our perception. Because we can only perceive within the boundaries of our perceptions, we cannot access, know, or disprove the existence of external entities. Consequently, Hume’s system does retain a subtle duality: there is the “internal” bundle of perceptions and a possible “external” reality beyond them. In contrast, the Buddhist perspective does not posit such *noumena*. It does not hint at any inaccessible ultimate reality; through **Buddha-nature**, the ultimate reality exists with (or within), not beyond, us (**Harvey** 2001, 109). Buddhism implies that enlightenment is possible, and enlightenment entails a direct realization of **nonduality**. Therefore, attempting to imagine a “Humean self” within a Buddhist context is problematic. The Humean model might allow for compatibilist (or Humean) free will, as it does not require a persisting self but instead demands only that the causes of actions (or events) be located within the “internal.” However, this framework still relies on a distinction between the “internal” domain of perceptions and the “external” *noumena*, and thus collapses if we accept **emptiness** and **nonduality** as ultimate truths.

Another avenue one might consider is whether the negation of a distinct, intrinsic self implies that, at the ultimate level, there must be a single, all-encompassing entity – “everything” as a unity that we can identify with, or at least identify as a “self.” If the dissolution of boundaries between self and other, subject and object, leads us to **nonduality**, one might hypothesize that this entails something like a “cosmic oneness.” In other words, if no independent selves exist, perhaps the only “self” that ultimately exists is the totality of all phenomena, taken as a single entity. By identifying with this oneness, could we reclaim a notion of free will – even incompatibilist free will – at the higher levels of truth? The line of reasoning is intuitive: it follows from **non-self** and **emptiness** that dividing one phenomenon from another is a matter of convention rather than ultimate truth. What we call “persons,” “houses,” or “galaxies” are simply clusters of interdependent processes and conditions, and if everything arises interdependently and no clear boundary can be drawn, why can we not assert – with the same conventional validity as using the five aggregates as a definition of the self – that everything is, in fact, “one” entity, and that we ourselves are not separate from it?

Some **Mahāyāna** texts and interpretations can appear to encourage such thinking. For instance, in the *Diamond Sutra*, the Buddha seemed pleased with Subhuti’s understanding that referring to the “3,000 galaxies” is ultimately just a figure of speech, since if they truly existed their reality would only lie in their “cosmic unity” (**John** 2024, 23). Similarly, passages in the *Lotus Sutra*, as interpreted by figures like Miao-lo and Daisaku Ikeda, describe the “ten onenesses” and the “oneness of life and its environment” and emphasize the inseparability of self and world (**Ikeda** 2022, 189–190; Nichiren Library 2002, "ten onenesses"). Contemporary commentators, such as Ben Connelly in *Inside Vasubandandhu’s Yogacara*, often state that realizing **emptiness** and **nonduality** entails realizing that there is no absolute gap between what we think of as “self” and the rest of existence (**Connelly** 2016, 193-194).

On the surface, these teachings seem to confirm the hypothesis that the “ultimate self” is a kind of unified whole. And, conveniently, if we adopt this “all-encompassing oneness” as our ultimate self, we might see a surprising re-emergence of the incompatibilist free will that we had previously dismissed at Level 3. As we established in our framework, incompatibilist free will demands that the agent be the originator of its actions, not caused by anything external. If “everything” is the agent, then there is nothing outside “everything” to originate its ends. Because there cannot exist something external to “everything,” then “everything” acts free of external conditions, is its own cause, and is thus, in a certain sense, “free.”

However, there are several critical points to complicate this argument. To begin with, Buddhism is generally very wary of reifying any concept, whether it is multiplicity or complete unity. The notion of “All is One” is a conceptual framework that risks turning **emptiness** into a form of **monism**. In the *Diamond Sutra*, although the Buddha approves of Subhuti’s dismantling of ordinary conceptions, he also insists that any notion of unity – “cosmic unity” included – is ultimately “unthinkable and unknowable” (**Johnson** 2024, 23). This suggests that it might be dubious to grasp “oneness” as a concrete metaphysical truth. Rather, it might be a skillful means to loosen attachment to rigid boundaries, not some final assertion that a single cosmic entity must exist. Additionally, to designate “everything” as an agent possessing free will introduces the conceptual problem of whether it makes sense to personify the totality. In Buddhism, “will” (*cetanā*) is a factor of mind associated with conscious beings (**Naing** 2005, 136). To ascribe this faculty to the entire universe would be to anthropomorphize it without justification. In Buddhism, the cosmos is not understood to be a grand person making choices, but rather an ongoing play of conditions and dependently arising phenomena that are empty of any permanent essence. Trying to translate this into a cosmic free-willing agent reinserts the kind of substantial metaphysics that the teaching of **emptiness** aims to dissolve. The argument that “everything” must at least exist as a single entity overlooks the meaning of **emptiness**. **Emptiness** denies inherent, independent existence, and thus also challenges the notion that “everything,” taken collectively, can form a single, independently existent “thing.” When the Buddha says that all form is illusory, he includes not only the discrete objects but also any conceptual sum of them – such as “3,000 galaxies” or the “cosmic unity.” Because every possible conceptual aggregate is also empty of intrinsic essence, they cannot be identified with a stable, ultimate self.

Thus, while the suggestion that “we are all one” might feel like a natural extension of **nonduality** and **non-self**, traditional Buddhist frameworks would caution against taking that conclusion literally. Teachings that emphasize the mutual identity of phenomena – like Miao-lo’s “ten onenesses” – aim to shatter dualistic thinking, not to require the acceptance of “oneness” as an ultimate metaphysical understanding. The Buddhist path leads beyond the frameworks that would re-establish free will at an ultimate level. The idea of a grand “oneness,” like the preceding truths that dissolved at the lower levels, is still ultimately provisional. While **nonduality** and **emptiness** seem to invite the idea that we might all be one, it's hard to say that Buddhism grants that this notion secures a place for free will at the highest levels of truth.
